# Media-Organizer
Movie Organizer
Place the Media Database.csv file anywhere and modify as needed. Although the program should be able to determne the delimeter, use commas between movie and place.
Do NOT modify the first line/row of the .csv file.
Make sure there is no blank line at the end of the file or the program will display an "undefined" row.
The entire folder can work standalone or on a server (such as WAMP).
